# Bitsweeper

## To-do
- [x] Support long press and right click for flagging
- [x] Add check for win state
- [ ] Win state?
- [ ] Loss state
- [ ] Add scoreboard UI - flag/mine counter (requires pixel font, make my own from sprites?), difficulty options, master volume? themes?
- [ ] Reducing gutter by 1?
- [ ] Add title screen

---
- [x] Limit right-click disabling to just the field. Be a good human.
- [ ] Sound: They are loud and grating! Using mine>explosion, thud/plant>flag, open>subtle chick. Add win sound.
- [ ] Animation: Add particles when you open block
- [ ] Animation: Flag placement
- [ ] Add loader
---
- [ ] Reduce sound file size. Convert to mp3?
- [ ] Turn eslint on save back on by updating vue.config.js?

## Bugs
- [ ] Switching tabs on mobile and returning to game disables further sound playing. Or putting phone on sleep. Do I need to re-import sound files?
