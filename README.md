# Bitsweeper

## To-do
- [X] Support long press and right click for flagging
- [ ] Add scoreboard UI - flag/mine counter (requires pixel font, make my own from sprites?), difficulty options, master volume? themes?
---
- [ ] Limit right-click disabling to just the field. Be a good human.
- [ ] Add particles when you open block
- [ ] Sounds are loud! plus come up with final
---
- [ ] Reduce sound file size. Convert to mp3?
- [ ] Turn eslint on save back on by updating vue.config.js?

## Bugs
- [ ] Switching tabs on mobile and returning to game disables further sound playing.
